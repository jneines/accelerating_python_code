`PyTorch` is the framework and `Python` interface on top of the `torch` library, which has been specifically built for machine learning purposes.

The origins of `torch` go back to the *IDAP* and *EPFL* research institutes.
`PyTorch` has originally been built at *Meta AI*. 

`PyTorch` mainly offers two things.
A tensor computing library following the `numpy` api closely, and *Deep Neural Networks*

The tensor computing library works both with a `CPU` and a `GPU` backend
and can therefore easily be used to help us overcoming the single-core computing boundary.

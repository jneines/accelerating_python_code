# Hardware

The next level is to look at the possible target environments where code is run.

With the options we've seen today three target environments play a role for working on speedups.

- stay on a local machine and no access to GPU for computation
- focus is a local machine with a GPU capable as a compute backend
- An environment for distributed computing exists

Decisions regarding the tooling have an effect on overall performance of the selected hardware environment.
Choose your setup wisely.

So, let's have a look at the recommendations for our targets.

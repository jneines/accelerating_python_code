# Introduction

We have used the plain functionality of `Pythons` standard library before to calculate the `Mandelbrot Set`.

As quite a lot of numerical computation is involved here,
we should have a look at the obvious choice to speed up things here 
and move on to work on whole arrays at once instead of calculating the bits one by one.

Especially driven by the interest in data science and machine learning using `Python`
there are quite some choices available here, the obvious first choice of course being `numpy`.

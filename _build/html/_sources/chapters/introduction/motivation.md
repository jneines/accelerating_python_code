# Motivation

Python is the language we all love especially for prototyping ideas.
It can be hard though to get the sketched ideas into production.

There may be many things preventing a direct use.

Things, such as 

- security concerns - *you missed the authentication in your demo!*
- non matching infrastructure and workflows - *Will it run on Windows then?*
- and attitudes about the language itself - *Your really want us to use an interpreted, untyped language that has a GIL in production?*
% (speed, untyped, GIL, ...)

might immediately come to mind here.

The good news is, there's low hanging fruits regarding the last point!

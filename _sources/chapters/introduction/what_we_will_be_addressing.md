# What we will be addressing

:::::{grid}

- Give an overview on possible solutions to speed up simple numerical calculations.
- Overcome Pythons main limitations here
- Prepare a strategy for scaling an execution model

We will be using a simple numerical formula to create a notable workload.
It's very well suited to do scaling experiments and let's you focus on the main possible issues.

- The dataset can be arbitrarily large
- Code is very simple an compact
- Runtime is varying drasticallly depending on the inputs
- It's a classical benchmark

# Chaos and Fractals

To show the possible speedups for numerical `Python` code, we use a very ideal example for computation belonging to the area of chaos and fractals.

**Chaos** in the scientific sense mainly stands for unpredictable behaviour in systems.
Think of the *Butterfly Effect*.
A very theoretical example for sure.

**Fractals** on the other hand show very complex patterns and shapes, very similar to natural structures, which can be produced by simple mathematical formulas and algorithms.

We're looking at a very special fractal today, the `Mandelbrot Set`.
